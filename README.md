<h2 align="left">About project</h2>

###

<p align="left">This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The Heart Disease dataset is used to train three models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Each modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using confusion matrices and accuracy scores to determine the most effective approach for predicting heart disease. The goal is to leverage these models to aid in early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes.</p>
